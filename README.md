ruby-qsort
==========

An implementation of quicksort in Ruby, along with a related algorithm to a median value.

Both of these files expect input consisting of a number N (the length of the
list of numbers to be sorted) followed on a new line by space-separated integers
representing the numbers to be sorted.

The median-finding program uses a process analogous to quicksort to find the
median value within its input. Like quicksort, it begins by partitioning the
array around a pivot value. Based on the lengths of the "sides" generated by
this partition, one can tell if this value is the median. If not, one can
throw out all values on the shorter side, saving only their overall length.
Choose another pivot within the longer side; test if it is the median based on
the lengths of the sides generated plus the number of values eliminated on each
side.

Note: this program assumes it receives an odd number of integers to sort.
